# OpenNLP

Apache OpenNLP is a machine learning toolkit for natural language processing tasks. It provides Java libraries for common NLP operations including tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.

The library includes pre-trained models for multiple languages and offers tools for training custom models on domain-specific data. OpenNLP is widely used in enterprise applications for text processing and analysis workflows.

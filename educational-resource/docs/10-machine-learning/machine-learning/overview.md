# Machine Learning Overview

Explore the world of machine learning in Java. From traditional ML algorithms to cutting-edge deep learning, discover how to build intelligent applications using Java's robust ecosystem.

## ðŸ§  What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. In Java, you can leverage powerful libraries and frameworks to build ML applications.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Areas Covered

### **Deep Learning**
Build neural networks and deep learning models using frameworks like DL4J (Deep Learning for Java) and ONNX Runtime.

### **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
Process and understand human language with tokenization, sentiment analysis, and language models.

### **Traditional ML**
Implement classic machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering.

## ðŸš€ Popular Java ML Libraries

| Library | Focus | Use Cases |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **DL4J** | Deep Learning | Neural networks, image recognition |
| **Weka** | Traditional ML | Classification, clustering |
| **Apache Spark ML** | Distributed ML | Large-scale data processing |
| **ONNX Runtime** | Model Inference | Cross-platform model deployment |

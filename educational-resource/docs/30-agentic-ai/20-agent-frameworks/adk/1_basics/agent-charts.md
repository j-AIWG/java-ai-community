# Agent Lifecycle Charts

Visual representations of the ADK agent lifecycle, showing the different states and transitions that agents go through during their execution. These charts help developers understand the agent's behavior and debug issues.

The agent lifecycle consists of several key states: Initialized, Running, Processing, Idle, and Terminated. Each state represents a different phase of the agent's operation, with specific transitions triggered by events like receiving a message, completing a task, or encountering an error.

Understanding these lifecycle charts is essential for building robust agents and implementing proper error handling and recovery mechanisms.

```java
agent.on("init", () -> {
    logger.info("Agent initialized");
});
```
You'll learn how to render transitions and triggers using the ADK's lifecycle hooks and logging API.

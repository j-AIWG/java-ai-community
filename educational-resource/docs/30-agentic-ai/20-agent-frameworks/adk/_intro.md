# Introduction to ADK

## Agent Development Kit (ADK)

ADK was recently launched by Google and allows developers to easily build agents and expose them to other agents via agent charts. It provides a comprehensive framework for creating production-ready AI agents with built-in support for state management, tool integration, and monitoring.

The framework is designed to simplify the development of complex agent systems by providing a standardized approach to agent creation, communication, and lifecycle management. ADK agents can be deployed individually or as part of larger multi-agent systems, making it ideal for both simple applications and complex enterprise solutions.

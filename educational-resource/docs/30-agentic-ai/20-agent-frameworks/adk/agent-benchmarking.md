# Agent Benchmarking Guide

This guide covers benchmarking setups for comparing ADK agent throughput across different runtime configurations. It provides methodologies and tools for measuring agent performance in various scenarios.

The benchmarking approach uses JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) and custom agent event streams to provide accurate performance measurements. This enables developers to optimize their agent implementations and compare different configurations for production deployment.

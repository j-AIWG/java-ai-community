# Agent Frameworks Overview

Discover the powerful world of AI agent frameworks in Java. These frameworks enable you to build intelligent, autonomous systems that can reason, plan, and execute complex tasks.

## ðŸ¤– What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous software systems that can:
- **Perceive** their environment through various inputs
- **Reason** about situations and make decisions
- **Act** by executing tasks or providing responses
- **Learn** from feedback to improve over time

## ðŸŽ¯ Featured Frameworks

### **LangGraph4J**
The Java implementation of LangGraph, enabling you to build stateful, multi-step AI applications with complex workflows and memory management.

### **ADK (Agent Development Kit)**
A comprehensive toolkit for building production-ready AI agents with built-in support for state machines, tool integration, and monitoring.

### **LangChain4J Agents**
Extend LangChain4J with agent capabilities for building conversational AI systems and task-oriented assistants.

## ðŸš€ Key Capabilities

Each framework provides:
- **State Management** - Maintain context across interactions
- **Tool Integration** - Connect to external APIs and services
- **Memory Systems** - Remember past interactions and learn
- **Workflow Orchestration** - Coordinate complex multi-step processes
- **Monitoring & Observability** - Track agent performance and behavior

## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

Choose your framework based on your needs:

| Framework | Best For | Complexity | Production Ready |
|-----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| LangGraph4J | Complex workflows | High | Yes |
| ADK | Enterprise agents | Medium | Yes |
| LangChain4J | Simple agents | Low | Yes |

## ðŸ“š Learning Path

1. **Start with LangChain4J** for basic agent concepts
2. **Move to ADK** for production applications
3. **Explore LangGraph4J** for advanced workflows
